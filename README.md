Unofficial LifeSteal ModPack designed for lifesteal.net

Why schould I choose this?

We offer a ModPack designed to elevate your Minecraft experience on LifeSteal.net. It incorporates essential Quality of Life (QoL) mods like Mouse Tweaks, ensuring smoother gameplay and optimizing your efficiency. With performance-focused enhancements, our ModPack includes optimization mods that significantly boost FPS and accelerate rendering, providing a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience.

To further enhance connectivity, we’ve added Simple Voice Chat (You can only speak with it if your Rank on LifeSteal.net is Hero or higher), making communication with fellow players effortless. Rest assured, all the mods included in our ModPack have been meticulously vetted to comply with server regulations. This means you won’t risk being banned for using mods that aren’t allowed or inadvertently trigger false bans.

Moreover, we understand the frustration of game crashes caused by incompatible mods. That’s why we rigorously test and ensure compatibility across all included mods. Our goal is to save you valuable time and allow you to focus on what truly matters—playing the game.

For transparency, a complete list of mods used in this ModPack is available under the “Dependencies” section if you selected the version you need. You get a reliable, optimized, and trouble-free LifeSteal experience.
